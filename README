There's a great script called symbolicatecrash that is distributed with the iOS SDK. It works great for symbolicating iOS crash logs, but doesn't work at all for Mac crash logs.

All the script is doing is automating the process described here: http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/439/crappy-crash-logs

This version of the script is targeted specifically at Mac app crash logs. Usage is very similar to 'symbolicatecrash'.
